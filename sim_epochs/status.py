"""Derive current / stale / superseded (decisions 3, 4, 5, 7).

- Group key = (family, tier, desc, purpose). Parent is NOT in the key.

- Within a group the highest DsconfKey.sort_key() is the winner, unless
  an `order` pin names one. Winning ANY group it competes in is enough
  (see `_winners`); an `order` pin that matches no group at all is
  reported in `cat.pin_problems`, never dropped.
- Winner is `current` if every member parent is current, else `stale`.
- Non-winners are `superseded`.
- Excluded members get status `excluded` and never compete.
- Holds never touch status.
Members are visited in topological order over member-parent edges so a
parent's status is final before its children are judged.

    The dead own-series `MDC20xx-NNN` convention parses with
    `purpose=None` while every lettered sibling carries `best` or
    `perfect`, so keying strictly on the 4-tuple put them in DIFFERENT
    groups and they never competed: 15 `(family, tier, desc)` lines in
    the 2026-09-03 run published two simultaneously current answers
    (`nts…ensembleMDS3dOnSpill.MDC2025-001.root` next to
    `…MDC2025au_best_v1_1-001.root`). That defeats wiki §5 rule 3 — the
    own-series convention "ranks below any lettered sibling" — and
    decision 7's rationale, "or Sophie gets two current answers".

    So a `purpose=None` member joins EVERY purpose group of its
    `(family, tier, desc)` and ranks lowest in each (appended after the
    sort), which makes any lettered sibling supersede it; with no
    lettered sibling at all it keeps a group of its own and stays
    current. `best` and `perfect` are NOT collapsed into one group —
    they are different products, decision 3.

    One consequence to state plainly (V4): because such a member
    competes in several groups and winning ANY of them makes it current
    (`_winners`, NEW-5), an `order` pin naming it in one purpose group
    leaves it current in the OTHER purpose groups too, next to their
    lettered winners. Those groups then publish two current members.
    That is the intended effect of a hand-placed pin — keeping a pinned
    dataset is the fail-closed direction — not the ungrouped-own-series
    bug this docstring's first paragraph describes."""
